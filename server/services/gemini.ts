- Offers a specific, actionable suggestion or reflection question
- Is appropriate for their current mood
- Is brief (1-2 sentences maximum)
- Focuses on self-care, mindfulness, or emotional wellness

- For happy mood: "Take a moment to savor this positive feeling. What three things contributed to your happiness today?"
- For sad mood: "It's okay to feel sad. Try writing down one small thing you're grateful for right now."
- For anxious mood: "When anxiety visits, remember that your breath is always available as an anchor. Try taking five deep, slow breaths."
