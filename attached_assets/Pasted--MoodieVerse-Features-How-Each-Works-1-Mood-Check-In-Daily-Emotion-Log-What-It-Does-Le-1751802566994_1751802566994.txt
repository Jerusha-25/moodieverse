🌍 MoodieVerse: Features & How Each Works
🟢 1. Mood Check-In (Daily Emotion Log)
✅ What It Does:
Lets the user track how they feel each day in a simple, visual way.

💡 How It Works:
On the home page, the user sees:

Emoji options (😄 😐 😢 😠 😟)

A text box to write about their day (optional)

They click “Submit Mood”

The app:

Stores the mood + journal in a local database

Sends the mood to the AI backend for analysis

Updates the visual world (e.g., foggy for sad, sunny for happy)

🧠 2. AI-Powered Prompt or Quest Generator
✅ What It Does:
Uses Gemini AI to provide personalized mental wellness suggestions based on mood.

💡 How It Works:
After submitting a mood:

The backend sends a request to Gemini API with the user's mood & journal entry

The response might include:

A self-reflection prompt: “What can you control today?”

A simple task: “Take 3 deep breaths.”

The prompt is shown on-screen in a beautiful card

The user can click:

[✍️ Reflect Now]

[✅ Mark as Done]

🌱 3. World Growth Engine (Gamification)
✅ What It Does:
Makes the user’s emotional growth visible through a blooming digital world.

💡 How It Works:
Every time the user:

Completes a self-care quest

Checks in consistently (e.g., 3-day streak)

The app shows:

A new flower/tree blooming in their digital garden

An updated world visual (e.g., clearer skies, more sunlight)

Progress is stored in the backend (e.g., streaks, number of blooms)

Optional animations (via Lottie or GIF) make it fun and rewarding

💌 4. Anonymous Kindness Exchange
✅ What It Does:
Let users send and receive anonymous supportive messages, like an emotional postcard.

💡 How It Works:
After check-in or quest completion, users see:

A box to send a kind message to someone else anonymously

Option to receive one too

Behind the scenes:

Messages are stored in a temporary message pool

If no messages are available, Gemini AI generates one

Example: “You’re doing better than you think.”

Messages are filtered by a toxicity detection model (like VADER) before being shown

📊 5. Mood Dashboard (Analytics & Progress)
✅ What It Does:
Gives users a personal visual summary of how they’ve been feeling over time.

💡 How It Works:
Shows:

A line graph of mood trends over the last 7 days

Number of quests completed

Garden growth summary (e.g., 12 flowers, 3 trees)

Their current streak

Data is pulled from the local database

Uses Plotly or Matplotlib to render charts

🚨 6. Crisis Mode (Emergency Support Toolkit)
✅ What It Does:
Provides instant help when users feel overwhelmed or anxious.

💡 How It Works:
Always-accessible floating button: “Need Help?”

On click:

Opens a modal with:

Breathing animation (looping Lottie or GIF)

5-4-3-2-1 grounding tool (interactive checklist)

Emergency helpline links based on region (static or from config)

🌈 7. Customizable World Themes (Optional / Future Scope)
✅ What It Does:
Lets users choose between world types like:

🌸 Garden

🪐 Space

🌊 Ocean

🏔️ Mountains

💡 How It Works:
When setting up the app, users select a theme

All visuals, animations, and growth assets update to match the theme

Theme stored in user settings (in database)

🔄 8. Mood Streak System (Engagement Loop)
✅ What It Does:
Encourages consistent self-care by rewarding streaks.

💡 How It Works:
Each day the user checks in:

Their streak counter increases

Rewards are triggered at milestones (3, 7, 14 days)

e.g., “You unlocked a rare flower!”

If a day is missed, streak resets

📤 9. Shareable World Snapshots (Social Sharing)
✅ What It Does:
Lets users export and share their healing progress (without revealing private mood data).

💡 How It Works:
On the dashboard or garden screen:

A button: “📸 Share My World”

It generates:

A beautiful snapshot image of their garden/planet with:

MoodieVerse logo

Day streak (e.g., “Day 5 of Healing 🌱”)

Optional quote from their journal or AI prompt

Download or share to Instagram, WhatsApp, etc.

🔐 10. Privacy-First Experience
✅ What It Does:
Ensures the user’s emotional data is never exploited or exposed.

💡 How It Works:
No sign-up/login required

Data stored locally or on a secure private database

Journals, mood logs, and messages are never shared unless user explicitly exports them
